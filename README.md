# Reimagen

Reimagen is a personal AI playground and portfolio site. It showcases the AI products, experiments, and tools I’m building, and serves as a hub for all my work across the web.

## What this site is

- **AI product showcase** – A living portfolio of apps, prototypes, and experiments built with modern AI models.
- **Generative media gallery** – Curated collections of AI‑generated images, video, text, and interactive pieces.
- **Developer toolkit** – Utilities, prompts, workflows, and small tools I use to build with AI.
- **Social hub** – Central place to link out to my socials, newsletters, and other projects.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** React + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via PostCSS)
- **Build & tooling:** Node.js, ESLint, Vite dev server
- **Deployment:** Static site hosting (e.g. Netlify/Vercel)

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the printed local URL in your browser.

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

This generates an optimized production bundle in `dist/`.

## Roadmap

- Add more AI product case studies and live demos
- Expand the generative media gallery with themed collections
- Publish reusable prompt libraries and starter templates
- Integrate richer analytics and contact/social flows

## Notes

This project was originally bootstrapped with the React + Vite template. For advanced configuration or deeper Vite usage, see the official docs: https://vitejs.dev/guide/
